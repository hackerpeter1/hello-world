##SummaryReport
---
The suammary training has been done. I have acquired a lot of knowledge and summary the new knowledge I have learned to this report for review. They are showing below. 
###Ant
Ant is a tool that converge functions like compile, run, build, test.  
I have used ant to build by xml data structure like Path, FileSet to specify the path of classpath which used in compile. 
\<property\> is the key value set that we can define the file path.  
\<target\> is need to be complete which mean just like it name.We use the property depends in <Target> to determine the dependency of targets.    
\<javac\> is used to compile java program.    
\<java\> is used to run the java program.    
###Junit
Junit is used to test the java program by junit. Junit is a tool to test the java unit, the java unit usually is a function. We can use the assert functions to assert the result. Compiler can check the assert result and play for you. We often prepare the object in the construct function below the @Before, and we use TestFunction to do unit test which below the statement @test.  
###Sonar
Sonarqube is a platform which can check the quality of the code. It help us form a better software engineer's programme habit.
###Vim 
It's a effective text edit tool. It have different mode like command mode, edit mode...  
The command in common use:   
i、a、o(enter the edit mode in different ways)  
dd x(num)(delete x lines) 
x(delete one lines)   
:wq(quit and save the file)  
p(paste)  
c(copy)...etc  
###Build the enviroment
I learned how the build the enviroment of the Java、Ant、Sonar in Ubuntu. We can rewrite the file etc\Profile.
###Shortcut Key in macOS
The shortcut key in macOS.  
alt and command is used to move the cursor. alt is move the cursor in blocks split by the space. Command is move the cursor to the rightmost、leftmost、upmost or downmost.  
shift + (alt/command) + up/down/left/right is used select the text.
###DFS and BFS
The key point that I want to say is that we mustn't use recursion and loop to complete the algorithm correspon to DFS and BFS. We can borrow data structure like stack  and queue to complete BFS and DFS.  
###Heuristic Search
The DFS and BFS are blind search, because we should  ergodic all the nodes. It's overload is high. So we can use the heuristic search to determine which node push into the structure by the estiemate function which return the cost of the node.  
###Finally
Thank you for teather and TAs.
